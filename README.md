# hello-world

Hello everyone.

Welcome to my code. This is particularly for Professor Lalor and Unstructured Data Analysis. I like coding in R and Python.
How has your day been professor?
You can take a break from grading if you want, I understand the pain of grading a bunch of assignments.
Either way, hope you are doing well.
